# About

The Digital Area Studies (DAS) research group is based at the Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages (IKOS) at the Faculty of Humanities, University of Oslo. Our aim is to encourage scholars in the humanities to use digital tools in research through themed seminars, hands-on, problem-solving workshops, and sharing through our website. 

We concentrate on learning and applying R to analyze data, create visualizations and working with text. We also aim to create a hub for resources on how to employ a plaintext workflow when working with non-Latin languages such as Arabic and Mandarin.

The DAS group meets every second Monday throughout the semester, and the program is available here. Besides serving as the home of repositories made by group members, this website functions as a communication hub between meetings.
